## About The App

We are the FSW C-10 team 👩‍💻, we collaborate with the Android team to develop this backend application which our Android teams and FSW frontend teams will later consume. We use Trello to collaborate and managing task 📆, and we follow Agile and Scrum methodologies for our work process 🏋🏻‍♂️.

The project focuses on a Massive Open Online Course theme and is designed for two types of users - the admin and the user 🙎🙎‍♂️. There are two types of courses available in the system, namely free 🆓 and premium courses 💸. The admin is responsible for managing both types of courses while users have the option to enroll in free courses or purchase premium courses using different payment methods such as bank transfer, Alfamart, Indomart, as well as digital wallets like Dana, OVO, and any others payment methods. \*we use midtrans for payment gateway 💳

This system includes a progress tracking feature that allows users to view the percentage 💯 of their progress as they watch courses they have either enrolled in or purchased. Additionally, the system provides a one-time-password (OTP) 🔢 feature for user registration and password resetting. Furthermore, there is also a notification feature that users can enable to stay updated on any important announcements. And any other feature are on these project, Lets Try it by yourself ✨ [Setup](#setup)
